# Data Analysis & Visualization Portfolio
This repository showcases projects where I transform raw datasets into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Each project highlights my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and reporting.

## Project

### Loan Data Analysis
- **Dataset:** Loan applications with demographic and financial details
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI
- **Analysis Sections:**
  1. **Loan Approval Analysis**
     - Explored trends in loan approvals
     - Investigated categorical factors such as credit history, education, employment, and property area
     - Visualized approval patterns and risk factors
  2. **Income & Loan Analysis**
     - Examined applicant and co-applicant income distributions
     - Studied the relationship between income and loan eligibility
     - Built visualizations to highlight financial patterns and insights

- **Highlights:**
  - Cleaned and preprocessed raw data for analysis
  - Created detailed visualizations for easy understanding of trends
  - Delivered actionable insights to inform loan approval decisions

## Features
